        <p1>India is home to a diverse array of marginalized communities, spread across various states and regions. </p1>
        <p4>These communities include Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and Other Backward Classes (OBCs), among others. </p4>
        <p2>The distribution of marginalized communities varies across states, with certain regions having a higher concentration of specific groups. </p2>
        <p3>Several factors contribute to the high concentration of marginalized communities such as historical practices, geographical factors, economic disparity, land rights and displacement and cultural diversity.</p3>

        <p1><strong>1942:</strong>
In 1942, India was still under British colonial rule. The struggle for independence was at its peak, and legal developments were intertwined with the broader political context. </p1>
<p2>The British administration had implemented various laws, including the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which stigmatized certain communities. The legal framework at this time laid the groundwork for post-independence reforms.</p2>

<p3><strong>1951:</strong>
 In 1951, the first census was conducted post-independence, which included the identification of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. </p3>

<p4><strong>1992:</strong>In 1992, one of the significant developments was the implementation of the 73rd Amendment to the Constitution, which decentralized power to the local level through Panchayati Raj institutions. </p4>
<p5>This had implications for marginalized communities as it aimed at ensuring their participation in grassroots governance. </p5>

<p6><strong>2019:</strong>In 2019, the legal landscape witnessed discussions and debates around the constitutional validity of affirmative action policies, particularly with respect to reservations in education and employment. </p6>
